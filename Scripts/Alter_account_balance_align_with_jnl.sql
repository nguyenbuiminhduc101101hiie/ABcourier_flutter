  ABFreight: align dbo.account_balance with jnl (correct) schema.

  WRONG (current ABFreight CREATE):
    UNIQUE UQ_account_balance_account_period (account_code, period_year, period_month)  -- no book_code

  CORRECT (jnl + indexes from SSMS):
    - No 3-column unique on CREATE TABLE
    - FK_account_balance_account_mapping -> account_mapping(account_code)
    - DEFAULT newid() on id
    - UNIQUE UQ_account_balance_account_period_book (account_code, period_year, period_month, book_code)
    - UNIQUE UQ_account_balance_company_account_period_book (company_id, account_code, period_year, period_month, book_code)

  Run on database ABFreight. Review orphan account_code rows before FK step.
